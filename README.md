## Introduction

The website "Balancing Bodyweight" focuses on calisthenics, a form of exercise that utilizes body weight for resistance training. It aims to promote fitness for all levels, from beginners to advanced athletes, emphasizing the following key points:

1. **Minimal Equipment Required**: Calisthenics can be performed with little to no equipment, making it accessible for everyone, whether at home, in a park, or while traveling.

2. **Improves Functional Strength**: The exercises engage multiple muscle groups, enhancing overall strength, coordination, balance, and flexibility, which can make daily activities easier.

3. **Progressive and Adaptable**: The exercises can be modified to suit different fitness levels, allowing individuals to progressively increase difficulty and challenge themselves over time.

Overall, the site encourages users to find their balance and elevate their strength through bodyweight training.

Description of the value this feature has for the users

Repeat for each feature

## Features to be Added

Describe some additional features you could potentially add to the project that would increase user value - could be things linked to technologies not yet covered by the course but would be a benefit to the user for example, the ability to save an article, or add an article to the site, leave a review.

## Testing

### Validation of Code

Insert screenshots of HTML, CSS and any other code files being tested in the relevant code validator - CSS validator might not validate newer CSS syntax - be careful to read and fully understand why it is giving you an error.

### Lighthouse

You can perform a test of your website for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO through the google chrome lighthouse test - it is in your Dev tools. Bear in mind that your internet connection speed plays a part in the performance figures obtained. Where it scores low, it will give you suggestions on how to improve the site - read the suggestions and think about how to implement them - it could be a good idea.
Do this for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing

You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,

| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | <- duplicate this line for each line you need

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

## Technologies Used

Detail what technologies you used. So what code languages, what frameworks, libraries, what software did you use to develop the site - Balsamic for your wireframes, Figma for a mockup?

## Deployment

Detail how to clone the repository, how to fork the repository - how to run the site locally and how to deploy it.

## Credits

You need to credit where you got anything for your site from.. where are the images from, are they all from the same site? where did you get the content from, if you wrote it yourself, did you fact check anywhere? did you get code from anywhere? if so, it needs to be clearly marked in both the code and the readme.
